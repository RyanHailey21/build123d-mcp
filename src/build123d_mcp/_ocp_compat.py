"""OCP 7.x / 8.x compatibility shims (#488).

OCP 8 (build123d 0.13+) moved the NCollection instantiations out of
``OCP.TopTools`` into ``OCP.collections`` and turned ``TopoDS`` into a namespace,
so the static downcasts lost their ``_s`` suffix (``TopoDS.Face_s`` →
``TopoDS.Face``). Import the version-neutral names from here instead.

The old names are tried first, so behaviour on OCP 7.x is unchanged.
